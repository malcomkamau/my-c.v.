        Hello. My name is <strong>Malcom Gakuo Kamau</strong>. I'm a <strong>software engineer</strong> currently taking an internship at Safaricom ltd. I was born on <strong>6th December, 2005</strong> in Nakuru county. After my internship which will enable me to have the experience of a software engineer I plan to apply for a job at your company. It has always been my dream to work at such a prestigeous organisation such as yours and I'm prepared to work hard for the chance to secure a job there.
